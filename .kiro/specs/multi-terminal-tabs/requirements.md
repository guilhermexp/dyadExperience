# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will enhance the Dyad terminal interface by implementing a multi-tab terminal system similar to VS Code/Cursor. Currently, the terminal only shows "System Messages" in a single view. The new system will allow users to create, manage, and switch between multiple terminal sessions, each running independent processes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Dyad, I want to create multiple terminal tabs so that I can run different processes simultaneously without interference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a "+" button in the terminal area THEN the system SHALL create a new terminal tab
2. WHEN a new terminal tab is created THEN the system SHALL initialize a new shell session for that tab
3. WHEN I have multiple terminal tabs THEN each tab SHALL maintain its own independent process state
4. WHEN I create a new terminal tab THEN it SHALL become the active tab automatically

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to switch between different terminal tabs so that I can monitor and interact with different running processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on a terminal tab THEN the system SHALL switch to that terminal's view
2. WHEN I switch between tabs THEN each tab SHALL preserve its command history and output
3. WHEN a tab is active THEN it SHALL be visually highlighted to indicate current selection
4. WHEN I switch tabs THEN the terminal input SHALL focus on the active tab's session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to close terminal tabs I no longer need so that I can keep my workspace organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click a close button on a terminal tab THEN the system SHALL close that terminal session
2. WHEN I close a terminal tab THEN the system SHALL terminate any running processes in that tab
3. WHEN I close the active tab AND other tabs exist THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to another available tab
4. WHEN I close the last terminal tab THEN the system SHALL create a new default terminal tab
5. WHEN I close a tab with running processes THEN the system SHALL show a confirmation dialog

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want each terminal tab to have a meaningful name so that I can easily identify different terminal sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new terminal tab is created THEN it SHALL have a default name like "Terminal 1", "Terminal 2", etc.
2. WHEN I right-click on a terminal tab THEN the system SHALL show an option to rename the tab
3. WHEN I rename a terminal tab THEN the new name SHALL be displayed on the tab
4. WHEN a terminal is running a specific process THEN the tab name MAY automatically update to reflect the process

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the terminal tabs to integrate seamlessly with the existing Dyad interface so that the user experience remains consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the multi-terminal feature is active THEN it SHALL maintain the existing "System Messages" functionality
2. WHEN the interface loads THEN the System Messages SHALL appear as the first tab by default
3. WHEN I interact with terminal tabs THEN the styling SHALL match the existing Dyad design system
4. WHEN terminal tabs are displayed THEN they SHALL not interfere with other UI elements in the application

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want keyboard shortcuts for terminal management so that I can efficiently work with multiple terminals.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I press Ctrl+Shift+` (or Cmd+Shift+` on Mac) THEN the system SHALL create a new terminal tab
2. WHEN I press Ctrl+Shift+W (or Cmd+Shift+W on Mac) THEN the system SHALL close the current terminal tab
3. WHEN I press Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown (or Cmd+Option+Left/Right on Mac) THEN the system SHALL switch between terminal tabs
4. WHEN I press Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2, etc. THEN the system SHALL switch to the corresponding terminal tab number

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the terminal system to handle errors gracefully so that one terminal failure doesn't affect other terminals or the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a terminal process crashes THEN only that specific tab SHALL be affected
2. WHEN a terminal session fails to start THEN the system SHALL show an error message in that tab
3. WHEN the terminal backend encounters an error THEN the system SHALL attempt to recover without losing other terminal sessions
4. WHEN a terminal becomes unresponsive THEN the user SHALL have an option to force-close that specific tab
